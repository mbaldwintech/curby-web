Run a health check on the project:

1. Run TypeScript type checking (`npx tsc --noEmit`) and report any errors
2. Run ESLint (`npm run lint`) and report any issues
3. Run the Next.js build (`npm run build`) and check for build errors
4. Check git status for uncommitted changes
5. Summarize the results concisely
